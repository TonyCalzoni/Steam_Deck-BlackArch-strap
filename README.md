Installation script that straps BlackArch on top of the Steam Deck running factory/official SteamOS

Dependency requirements: jq, zenity (Both are installed by default on SteamOS)

WARNING: parts of this script will need to be run again after every update due to the immutable nature of Valve's SteamOS

Initial testing on Steam Deck seems to work, I'll have to try again at the library soon since the wifi in my building sucks
